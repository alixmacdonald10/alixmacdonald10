## :crab: About Me

I’m a **Rustacean by day, Kubernetes wrangler by night**.
I write memory-safe code like it’s my job (because it is).
If it compiles, it’s probably correct——unless I’m deploying at 3 AM, in which case I’m too busy to care.
*(Disclaimer: This is a joke. I always care. Especially when my employer is reading this.)*

**Cloud Native? More like Cloud Native with extra coffee.**
I’ve spent more time in Azure than most people spend in traffic jams, and I’ve dabbled in AWS enough to know where the bodies are buried.

**Python?** Yeah, I can write it. Do I like it? Let’s just say I miss the Rust compiler.

I have a strong proclivity towards **postgres**. 

**TL;DR:**
- Rust is language of choice.
- Kubernetes is my go to.
- Azure is the best of a bad bunch?
- AWS is… interesting...
- Python is tolerated.
- Postgres is preffered.
- IAC is a bit of me.
