## :crab: About Me

Alright? I'm Alix.

I’m a **Rustacean**, I really enjoy **Kubernetes** and I find **System Design** very rewarding. I write secure, correct code like it’s my job (because it is). 

**Cloud Native? More like Cloud Native with extra coffee.** I’ve spent more time in Azure than most people spend in traffic jams, and I’ve dabbled in AWS enough to know where the bodies are buried.

**Python?** Yeah, I can write it. Do I like it? Let’s just say I miss the Rust compiler.

I have a strong proclivity towards **Postgres**. 

**TL;DR:**
- Rust is language of choice.
- Kubernetes is my go to.
- AWS or Azure makes no difference to me.
- Python is tolerated.
- Postgres is preffered.
